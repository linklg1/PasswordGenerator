# PasswordGenerator

A website runs a user friendly password generator which prompts the user to include what type of characters or numbers they want in their password as well as the length they desire. As the user enters the length they desire and confirms their choices of multiple attributes including case, numerical values, and special characters, a password is generated according to their request.
